Weather app for freeCodeCamp

This app allows users to see the weather in their current location (master branch) or search for a city and view its weather (react branch). The user can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather and they can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The React branch was built as a way for me to practice using React and managing state changes.
